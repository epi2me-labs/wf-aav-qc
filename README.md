# AAV QC workflow

QC of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) preparations.



## Introduction

This workflow takes reads sequenced from adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector preps and 
does some basic quality control checks. The main stages of the workflow are: 


+ Masking of transgene cassette variable ITR regions
+ Mapping reads to a combined reference sequence containing host cell reference genome, mask transgene plasmid and other AAV plasmids
+ Identification of reference which each reads maps to
+ Truncation hotspot identification
+ ITR transgene cassette coverage
+ Determination of AAV genome structure types
+ Calling transgene plasmid variants and creation of consensus 




## Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 8
+ Memory = 32GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 4
+ Memory = 16GB

Approximate run time: 15 minutes per sample - 150k reads and 8 cpus

ARM processor support: True




## Install and run


These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line.
You can also access the workflow via the
[EPI2ME Desktop application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage
compute and software resources,
therefore Nextflow will need to be
installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html)
to provide isolation of the required software.
Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.
This is controlled by the
[`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles)
parameter as exemplified below.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository
in order to run the workflow.
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can
be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow.
This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of
Nextflow and provide a list of all parameters
available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-aav-qc --help
```
To update a workflow to the latest version on the command line use
the following command:
```
nextflow pull epi2me-labs/wf-aav-qc
```

A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow.
It can be downloaded and unpacked using the following commands:
```
wget https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-aav-qc/wf-aav-qc-demo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf wf-aav-qc-demo.tar.gz
```
The workflow can then be run with the downloaded demo data using:
```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-aav-qc \
	--fastq 'wf-aav-qc-demo/simulated_reads.fq' \
	--itr1_end 156 \
	--itr1_start 11 \
	--itr2_end 2286 \
	--itr2_start 2156 \
	--ref_helper 'wf-aav-qc-demo/helper.fasta' \
	--ref_host 'wf-aav-qc-demo/cell_line.fasta.gz' \
	--ref_rep_cap 'wf-aav-qc-demo/repcap.fasta' \
	--ref_transgene_plasmid 'wf-aav-qc-demo/transgene.fasta' \
	-profile standard
```

## Pipeline overview

<!---High level numbered list of main steps of the workflow and hyperlink to any tools used. If multiple workflows/different modes perhaps have subheadings and numbered steps. Use nested numbering or bullets where required.--->

The following (Fig.1) is a basic schematic of the workflow:
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/wf-aav-qc_overview_outline.png" alt="AAV QC overview"/>
<figcaption>Fig.1 wf-aav-qc workflow</figcaption>
</figure>

### 1: Make a combined reference sequence 
Reads can originate from the transgene cassette, but can also come from the other plasmids
used in the rAAV prep as well as host cell DNA. Therefore, a combined reference is created
that contains the following reference sequences (with relevant parameter):
* transgene plasmid with variable ITR regions masked; see below (`ref_transgene_plasmid`).
* host reference genome (`ref_host`)
* Rep-Cap plasmid (`ref_rep_cap`)
* helper plasmid (`ref_helper`)

An alternative to supplying the non-transgene plasmid sequences individually is to place them into a folder and reference
this folder with the parameter `non_transgene_refs`.



The transgene plasmid ITR cassette will naturally exist in four orientations. 
(termed flip-flip, flip-flop, flop-flop and flop-flip; see Fig.2)
This can lead to incorrect mapping of reads. To address this, the variable regions in the transgene cassette are masked.
This is done by taking the input transgene plasmid and locating the two ITR regions as defined in the `--transgene_annotation`
file. The `C'`, `C`, `B'` and `B` ITR regions are identified for each ITR. From these regions it can be determined which positions are constant between orientations and which are variable, and will be masked.

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/combined_reference.png" alt="Combined reference"/>
<figcaption>Fig.2 Making a combined reference</figcaption>
</figure>

### 2: Map to reference and get alignment summaries
The reads are mapped to the combined reference using minimap2 (secondary alignments are excluded).
`seqkit bam` is used to generate alignment summaries that are used in the rest of the workflow. 

### 3: Contamination
Reads that do not map to the transgene expression cassette are classified as contaminants. They can arise from
* The Rep-Cap or helper plasmids
* The host expression system
* None of the above reference sequences. The reads will be classified as `Unknown`. If there are a large proportion of reads 
in this category, it may warrant further investigation to identify the source.
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/contamination.png" alt="Contamination"/>
<figcaption>Fig.3 Contamination summary plot </figcaption>
</figure>


### 4: Per-base coverage of the transgene cassette
Depth of coverage is generated for the transgene cassette region using `samtools depth`. 
A plot of this data is shown which indicates whether sufficient coverage has been
achieved across the transgene cassette.
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/coverage.png" alt="Coverage" height="300"/>
<figcaption>Fig.4 ITR-ITR coverage</figcaption>
</figure>


### 5: Identification of transgene plasmid variants
Transgene plasmid variants are called using [medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka), producing a VCF file that is used to generate a consensus sequence using [bcftool concensus](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#consensus)
The workflow selects the appropriate Medaka models based on the basecaller configuration that was used to process the signal data.
By default, the workflow will attempt to determine the basecaller model from the input data.
When this fails (or when you wish to override the automatic selection), it can be provided with `--override_basecaller_cfg`.



### 6: Identification of truncated regions
The 'start' and 'end' positions of alignments that map within the transgene cassette are plotted to highlight potential
regions where sequences are becoming truncated.

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/truncations.png" alt="Truncations plot" height="300"/>
<figcaption>Fig.5 Plot of start and end positions of reads mapping to transgene cassette. </figcaption>
</figure>

### 7: rAAV structure determination
The rAAV transgene expression cassette will ideally exist as full length ITR-flanked regions. 
However, subgenomic particles will be present in any prep, and it can be useful to know the abundance of the various genome
types, which is the aim of this stage of the workflow. Genome types are assigned to each read by applying a series of heuristics that use the characteristics of each alignment from the read. 

There are two user-adjustable parameters relevant to this part of the workflow:
* `--itr_fl_threshold` (default 100). This parameter specifies the maximum number of bases missing from an ITR in order for it to be classed as a full length ITR. 
* `--itr_backbone_threshold` (default 20). Reads mapping to the transgene plasmid sometimes extend beyond the ITRs. This parameter sets a maximum number of bases after which the read is classified as `backbone`.

See the [AAV structures](#aav-structure-diagrams) section for some representative diagrams of AAV gene structures and how they are classified.

At this stage, the BAM alignment files are tagged with `AV:Z` which associates each alignment with an assigned genotype, in the format `AV:Z:full_ssaav`. If the read does not map to the transgene plasmid, it will be assigned the tag `AV:Z:non_transgene`.

If --gtype_bams is set to `true`, these tagged BAMs are split on this tag into separate BAM files.



## Troubleshooting

<!---Any additional tips.--->
+ If the workflow fails please run it with the demo data set to ensure the workflow itself is working. This will help us determine if the issue is related to the environment, input parameters or a bug.
+ See how to interpret some common nextflow exit codes [here](https://labs.epi2me.io/trouble-shooting/).

+ Please ensure that the ITR-ITR cassette region spans and contiguous range in the transgene plasmid reference sequence.
(i.e. ITR1 sequence should precede the ITR2 sequence)

## AAV structure definitions

The following diagrams illustrate representative examples of the main genome configurations identifiable by wf-aav-qc.

The definitions are derived from [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2022.08.027) 

To begin with, here are some definitions of terms used in the following section:

**Complete ITR**:
> For a given genome structure, the ITR regions are classed as `complete` if the whole ITR sequence is
covered by an alignment. However, ITR regions are unstable and can often be missing parts of the terminal regions.
When the number of bases missing from an ITR is below a certain size, it may remain functional.
In order to not reject potentially functional partial ITRs, the workflow classes ITRs as `complete` if they are missing
less than `itr_fl_threshold` terminal bases (default 100).

**Partial ITR**:
> ITRs are classed as `partial` if there is alignment support, but the number of bases covered is less than or equal to `ITR length - itr_fl_threshold`.
For example, given an ITR of 145 nt and with the default `itr_fl_threshold` of 100, an ITR would be classed as `partial`
if less than 45 nt was covered.

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/complete_partial_itr.png" alt="Partial and complete ITRs"/>
</figure>


**Payload**:
> The genetic material of interest that is to be delivered into cells. In the diagrams below this is indicated by the 
bright and pale orange boxes that represent a promoter and gene of interest.

### 1. Single stranded AAV (ssAAV)
ssAAV is a single-stranded genome flanked by inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs).
The workflow classifies these genome types into either full or partial ssAAV.


#### 1.1 Full ssAAV
Contains a single alignment including both `complete` ITRs.

Reads are assigned as originating from a full ssAAV genome if it meets the following criteria:
* There exists a single alignment per read that maps to the transgene plasmid cassette 
* Both ITRs are present and `complete`


<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/full_ss.png" alt="Example"/>
</figure>

#### 1.2 Partial ssAAV
There are several categories of partial ssAAV each defined by which parts of the transgene cassette are absent.

##### 1.2.1 Incomplete genome (ICG)
ICGs are identified as reads that result in a single transgene cassette alignment, 
but one or both ITRs are absent or not `complete`.
They are further categorized by which ITR is present (if any).

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/icg.png" alt="ICG"/>
</figure>


##### 1.2.2 Genome deletion mutants (GDM)
This genome type is characterized by the loss of the central part of the genome. 
A read will be assigned a GDM type if it has two alignments to the transgene cassette on the same strand with a gap in between. 
The ITRs may be `complete`, `partial` or absent.

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/gdm.png" alt="GDM"/>
</figure>


### 2 Self-complementary AAV (scAAV)

scAAV genomes are created using a modified ITR sequence that has a mutated terminal resolution site, which results in a 
self-complementary viral genome with an internal ITR and is flanked by terminal ITRs.  

The workflow identifies reads as originating from scAAV genomes if they meet the following criteria:
* Has two alignments to transgene cassette.
* Each alignment maps to opposite strands.


#### 2.1 Full scAAV
Contains a `complete` ITR on both ends of the alignments. Note that the internal ITR will be included in both 
alignments as the ITRs are partially palindromic.  
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/full_sc.png" alt="Full scAAV"/>
</figure>

Below is a screenshot from IGV showing an example of a read assigned the `full scAAV` type.
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/full_sc_igv.png" alt="scaav_igv"/>
</figure>


#### 2.2 Snapback Genome (SBG)
SBG genomes are a subtype of self-complementary AAV particle that have missing parts of the genome but contain
ITRs on both the 5' and 3' ends. 

They can be further classified as either symmetrical, asymmetrical or unresolved:
* Symmetrical: This is where the same amount of each complementary part of the genome has been deleted.
* Asymmetrical: This is where varying amounts of each complementary part of the genome has been deleted.
If the size of the non-overlapping regions of each alignment is greater than `symmetry_threshold` (default 10),
it is classed as asymmetrical.
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/sbg.png" alt="SBG"/>
</figure>


#### 2.3 Unresolved SBG
A type of self-complementary AAV characterised by pronounced genome loss of, and asymmetry between, the complementary parts of
the standard genome. Inferring the structure of these AAV genome subtypes can be difficult, so some representative
alignments (a-e) are shown rather than structure diagrams:
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/unresolved_sbg.png" alt="Unresolved SBG"/>
</figure>

### 3 Other 

#### 3.1 ITR region only
These small subgenomic particles contain no payload and can consist of either:
a. Single ITR sequence
b. Two concatenated ITRs. 

<figure>
<img src="docs/images/genome_diagrams/itr_only.png" alt="ITR concatemers"/>
</figure>


#### 3.2 Backbone integration
This genome category contains DNA sequence originating from the plasmid backbone.
The start and/or end positions of the alignment are found outside the ITR-ITR region.
An allowance can be made for some backbone plasmid contamination, and this can be set with the `itr_backbone_threshold` parameter (default 20)

#### 3.3 Complex
Reads with overlapping alignments, or 3 or more alignments, are assigned to the complex category.
They can’t be assigned to a single structural category and the mapping pattern might indicate 
genomic rearrangements or concatemers.

#### 3.4 Transgene unclassified
Reads that map to the transgene plasmid but are not covered by any of the other categories.
Reads of this category are typically infrequently seen.
